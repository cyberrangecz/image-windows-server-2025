This repo contains Packer files for building Windows Server 2019 amd64 Standard Desktop base image for QEMU/OpenStack.

SSH and WinRM is enabled, SSH login using password is disabled.

## Image for QEMU/OpenStack

For building this image for QEMU locally, additional [iso image with Windows drivers for QEMU](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso) must be downloaded. Use this command to download it: `wget -nv -nc https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso -O virtio-win.iso`.

There is one admin user account:

*  `windows` with password set to random upon startup by [cloudbase-init](https://cloudbase-init.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) unless password is provided via OpenStack metadata `admin_pass`
